    "message": "## Founder's story\n\nI started my journey as a modest student in Vietnam. I did not consider myself a genius,\nbut I was determined to succeed. I worked hard and was able to get into the best\nuniversity in Vietnam. During the process, I got access to the most important toolset\nfor my learning: the internet. I was able to learn any thing I needed in order to embark\non my academic journey, including getting a perfect score on the SAT and\nscholarships. Inspired by this experience, I wanted to share these possibilities with other students.\nThat's why I founded LECOLE — to provide an affordable and effective toolset helping them reach their own goals.\n\nAlong the way, I was lucky to have met two people who are now my great friends.\nWe started to work on this idea together until we got the first version of LECOLE as a simple\nDigital SAT practice platform. Despite its simplicity, this early app quickly\namassed a significant user base, providing us with invaluable feedback. Our mantra is to build\na product that is not just a tool, but a community. We want to create a place where you\ncan learn, share your knowledge and achieve your goals.\n\nThis user-centric approach has earned us recognition from media outlets, including National Television,\nand attracted interest from foreign investors. However, for now, my priority is to keep the company lean\nand intensely focused on product development. This ensures our growth remains organic and directly guided\nby the needs and experiences of our users.\n\n## Our mission\n\nThe interface of our apps reflects our core philosophy: exceptional user experience and intuitive ease-of-use are paramount.\nWe strive to create a product so intuitive that tutorials aren't necessary—something you can use easily, almost intuitively, like your own hand tools.\n\nWe originally developed this application for our own use as students and researchers and hoped that it might be useful to others as well.\nFundamentally, our motivation comes from the rigorous standards of Vietnam's competitive examinations and educational system;\nwe are committed to taking advantage of that quality to enable everyone to learn more easily and effectively.\n\nIn the future, we plan on continuing to develop our platform with more features and subjects.\nAs we grow further, we are committed to making more content free and giving back to the community.\nWe firmly believe that education is basic and boundless—nothing should come in the way of a motivated learner.\n\n## Our aspiration\n\nOur vision is to build the ultimate destination for students worldwide to learn, share knowledge, and chase their dreams.\nWe wish to take the torch of Vietnamese educational quality to the global stage and combine it with the power of advanced AI to design a truly effective and enjoyable experience of learning.\n\nWith that in mind, we know the company is in its early stages.\nWe are a small team now, still figuring out how to make a truly incredible product.\nThere will be errors along the way, but here is our promise to you: we will always listen to your feedback and strive to improve our site at record-breaking speed.\n\nLastly, our team at LECOLE, we pride ourselves at the latest pivot of the company as it reflects our passion for innovation and change. We want to share the message of a world-class product, originating from the S-shaped country and to express our following the ethos of Vietnamese government in the Aspirational Era.\n\nI truly believe that our adventure is just beginning, and I'm excited about the future we can build together. Thanks for traveling with us so far.\n"
