## Founder's story

I started my journey as a modest student in Vietnam. I did not consider myself a genius,
but I was determined to succeed. I worked hard and was able to get into the best
university in Vietnam. During the process, I got access to the most important toolset
for my learning: the internet. I was able to learn any thing I needed in order to embark
on my academic journey, including getting a perfect score on the SAT and
scholarships. Inspired by this experience, I wanted to share these possibilities with other students.
That's why I founded LECOLE — to provide an affordable and effective toolset helping them reach their own goals.

Along the way, I was lucky to have met two people who are now my great friends.
We started to work on this idea together until we got the first version of LECOLE as a simple
Digital SAT practice platform. Despite its simplicity, this early app quickly
amassed a significant user base, providing us with invaluable feedback. Our mantra is to build
a product that is not just a tool, but a community. We want to create a place where you
can learn, share your knowledge and achieve your goals.

This user-centric approach has earned us recognition from media outlets, including National Television,
and attracted interest from foreign investors. However, for now, my priority is to keep the company lean
and intensely focused on product development. This ensures our growth remains organic and directly guided
by the needs and experiences of our users.

## Our mission

The interface of our apps reflects our core philosophy: exceptional user experience and intuitive ease-of-use are paramount.
We strive to create a product so intuitive that tutorials aren't necessary—something you can use easily, almost intuitively, like your own hand tools.

We originally developed this application for our own use as students and researchers and hoped that it might be useful to others as well.
Fundamentally, our motivation comes from the rigorous standards of Vietnam's competitive examinations and educational system;
we are committed to taking advantage of that quality to enable everyone to learn more easily and effectively.

In the future, we plan on continuing to develop our platform with more features and subjects.
As we grow further, we are committed to making more content free and giving back to the community.
We firmly believe that education is basic and boundless—nothing should come in the way of a motivated learner.

## Our aspiration

Our vision is to build the ultimate destination for students worldwide to learn, share knowledge, and chase their dreams.
We wish to take the torch of Vietnamese educational quality to the global stage and combine it with the power of advanced AI to design a truly effective and enjoyable experience of learning.

With that in mind, we know the company is in its early stages.
We are a small team now, still figuring out how to make a truly incredible product.
There will be errors along the way, but here is our promise to you: we will always listen to your feedback and strive to improve our site at record-breaking speed.

Lastly, our team at LECOLE, we pride ourselves at the latest pivot of the company as it reflects our passion for innovation and change. We want to share the message of a world-class product, originating from the S-shaped country and to express our following the ethos of Vietnamese government in the Aspirational Era.

I truly believe that our adventure is just beginning, and I'm excited about the future we can build together. Thanks for traveling with us so far.
